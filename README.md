## **<h2 align="center">Chat Application</h2>**

# Project Description
Snapchat was insanely popular due to it's nature of anonymous and private messaging. I have designed this app to replicate that feature but in chat messaging. User can define their personal name Alias and hop in a chat room of a programming language of their liking. Each room is alerted when a user joins or leaves with additional admin messages implemented.
